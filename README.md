# What is finished about the game so far
    The game's levels are complete. The next step is to possibly add more enemies to level 2 because it may be too easy. Also I want to add more lives to the final boss so it does not die in one fire ball. Besides this the game is basically done (gameplay wise)

## What still needs to be added
    More sounds for attacks and damaging sounds
    Boss level music
    More Palette modification
    more moving background for pause screen 
    fix when to play songs

## Any bugs you have found
    I have a moving background on my start screen but for some reason it only works when you go into the instructions first then return to the start screen. The moving background is not visible at first, so when you first launch the game, go into the instructions then return to the start screen.
    
**For our sake, how to play/navigate the game in its current state (and see anything you want us to see).**
    Two moving backgrounds: level 1 Pause screen in game and also Start screen (after you go to instructions or after you die)

    Looping sound: Start screen music
    
    Non-looping sound: fireball sound effect

    Change tile map at runtime: Press B while in the start screen to see smiley faces pop up

    Change palette at runtime: Press B while in the start screen (was originally orange. The new ones have been modified to be blue by accessing color in pal row 1)

    The way to navigate through the game's levels is to reach the transer portal. Touching it should teleport you to the next level. However when you reach the boss level you must first kill the boss for the portal to work.

    If you get hit by an enemy you die.
